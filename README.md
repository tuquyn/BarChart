# BarChart

D3.js

Horizontal bar chart with xAxis GDP and yAxis Province with 20 first province  
Feature: Add/Remove a new province with transition when click, axis changes depend on data  

Tooltip: sort by name/ GDP  
Some errors happens when changing type of tooltip and add new element - can fix by replace filter = push to array
